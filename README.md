### Windows 11 Local Account
Windows 11 liek to try to force you to use a Microsoft account instead of a local account. You used to be able to just disconnect the machine from the internet during the account creation portion of the OOBE setup process. Now, it complains if the machine does not have internet. 

You can still make a local account by going thorugh the Microsoft account login process; however, enter `no@thankyou.com` for the email address and something like `nope` for the password. It will tell you that account cannot be used due to it being used too many times. Then, it will proceed to let you create a local account.
